# TekWar Remake
I released the source because I'm discontinuing the project.

## Tools Needed
- Unity 3.5.6f4 Pro version - newer versions Unity 4 and above break the game scene, if you upgrade you have to manually adjust the objects on the map
- Any 3d model editor that supports 3DS MAX 2009 **MAX** files
- Any image editor that supports **PNG, TGA, PSD** - PSD files were made in Photoshop 10.0 CS3
- Any sound editor that supports - **WAV, MP3**
- Any video editor that supports - **MPG, MP4**
- QuickTime - if planning to rerender the videos
